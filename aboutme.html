                    <h4>Some artistic projects I've worked on:</h4>
                    <p>I've recently started working in digital art after years of drawing. It's a relatively new project but it's been fun to work in a different medium.
                        <br> This is a drawing I did last year of my cat having a nap.</p>

            <h3>Smart Goals for 2023:</h3>
            <p>My goals for 2023 are to firstly succeed in graduating from the business intelligence analytics program; having this diploma has been a goal of mine since I graduated
            from Mount Saint Vincent University in 2019. My other goals are to have a job in the industry before I graduate in April. My background is in marketing through my education but I am not
            solely looking for a marketing position. I also have experience in retail and health care and I would love to learn more in these areas as well.
             I love working with data and I'm excited to learn about new industries.

                        and rewrite my resume or cover letter strategies to apply for the second round of applications.

                        skillset, I just need to find out what they're looking for in an application process.

                        for applications. From that point on, it will take approximately a month to two months to hear back from companies if I meet their application requirements.
